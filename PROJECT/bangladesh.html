            <h2>Welcome to Insights of Bangladesh</h2>
            <p>Bangladesh, located in South Asia, is a country known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant history, and diverse landscapes. With a population exceeding 160 million, it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.</p>
            <p>The economy of Bangladesh is primarily agrarian, with agriculture being the main occupation of the majority of the population. However, in recent years, the country has witnessed significant growth in various other industries, contributing to its economic development and stability.</p>
            <p>Let's delve into some of the major industries that drive Bangladesh's economy:</p>

        <h1>Major Industries of Bangladesh</h1>
        
        <section id="textile" class="industry-section">
            <div class="texttile-content">
            <h2>Textile Industry</h2>
            <p>Bangladesh boasts the world's largest textile industry, second only to China in exports. This vital sector is the backbone of the nation's economy, contributing approximately 80% to total export earnings. Remarkably, it employs around 3.5 million people, with women making up 80% of the workforce, showcasing a significant female labor presence. In 2009, the industry's exports reached US$ 120.1 billion, primarily to Europe (60%) and America (40%).

                Despite its economic importance, the textile sector faces challenges, including low wages and poor working conditions, with restrictions on labor unions and strikes.</p>

                <p> Bangladesh's economy, one of the fastest-growing globally with a 7.1% GDP increase in 2016, owes much of its success to the textile industry, which includes textiles, clothing, and ready-made garments (RMG). This sector, contributing 28.1% to the total GDP, faces challenges such as political instability and the need for improved labor conditions. Despite these obstacles, the industry's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.86% over the past decade showcases its resilience and potential for sustained growth. 
                    Primary Contributor: Suyeon Han highlights the importance of enhancing workers' rights and ensuring minimum safety standards to mitigate risks and preserve the sector's growth trajectory. 
                    The graph below illustrates the garment industry's consistent development despite occasional downturns, emphasizing its significant role in Bangladesh's economy and the necessity for balanced labor laws and infrastructure investment to maintain this upward trend.</p>

            <div class="industry-content">
                <h2>Farming</h2>
                <p>Agriculture is a pivotal sector in Bangladesh, being the largest employer and a significant contributor to the country's GDP, involving around 60% of the population. It plays a crucial role in achieving macroeconomic objectives like poverty reduction, employment, food security, and human development. 
                    Despite the government's efforts to meet the food needs of its population, challenges such as frequent floods have hindered achieving this goal.</p>

                    <p>The country's fertile lands support the cultivation of primary crops like rice, jute, tea, tobacco, wheat, tomatoes, and pulses. Rice, the principal crop, sees three harvests annually, with a notable production of 35.8 million metric tons in 2000. 
                        Although labor-intensive farming has boosted food grain production, challenges like a growing population pressure and underemployment significantly strain the agricultural sector's productive capacity, leading to food deficits.</p>

                <h2>Shipbuilding</h2>
                <p>The shipbuilding industry in Bangladesh has shown significant growth potential, aiming to become one of the country's largest industries. Its history dates back to the early modern era but saw substantial development in recent years, particularly with locally made ships being exported overseas. 
                    Bangladesh now boasts over 200 shipbuilding companies, mainly located in key cities like Dhaka, Khulna, Narayanganj, Chittagong, and Barisal.</p>

                <p>Ananda Shipyard and Shipways Limited, established in 1983, was the first shipbuilding and exporting company in Bangladesh. It has secured numerous contracts, primarily from EU countries. 
                    Other notable companies include Khan Brothers Shipbuilding Limited and Western Marine Shipyard. Bangladesh's shipbuilding potential has drawn comparisons to major players like China, South Korea, and Japan.</p>
